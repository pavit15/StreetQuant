# Street Quant
**Numbers don't lie, but most stock tools do.**  
This is different, it is like having a Wall Street quant in your pocket.  
No fluff. No confusing jargon. Just cold, hard facts about your investments.

From analyzing returns and risk to running statistical stationarity tests,  
**Street Quant bridges the gap between quantitative finance and usability**  
for analysts, traders, and data science enthusiasts alike.

## What It *Actually* Does
### 1. Cuts Through the Noise
- "239% return!" → _But at 52% volatility and a 16% max loss._
- "Beating the market!" → _With 1.6× more risk (Beta)._

Street Quant breaks down every stock’s story into **risk-adjusted performance**, showing:
- Sharpe Ratio  
- Beta & Alpha  
- Maximum Drawdown  
- Annualized Return vs. Volatility  

### 2. Finds Hidden Risks
Most tools ignore what actually kills performance: **tail risk**.

This tool gives you:
- **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**  
- **Stationarity checks** (ADF test)  
- **Rolling Volatility** and **Rolling Sharpe Ratio**  

### 3. No Sugarcoating
- **Rolling metrics** show how performance *evolved*, not just the final number  
- **Q-Q plots** expose if gains are statistical noise  
- **Risk-return plots** compare your picks to the **actual market**
